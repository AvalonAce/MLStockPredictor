## Overview
This project applies various machine learning algorithms to predict stock prices and analyze trends using historical stock data. Techniques include data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model selection, creation, and evaluation.

## Installation
Clone this repository and install the necessary packages:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AvalonAce/MLStockPredictor.git
cd MLStockPredictor
```

*Requirements include packages like `pandas`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn`, and `matplotlib`.*

## Dataset
The data used in this project is from the NYSE dataset on Kaggle. Please download it [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/samhithasudha/nyse-stock-exchange-data) and place it in the `data/` directory.

## Usage
Open the Jupyter Notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook Stock_Predictor.ipynb
```

Follow the instructions in the notebook to run the data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation sections.

## Models Implemented
The following models are explored and compared:
- IN-PROGRESS

## Results
Key findings, performance metrics, and visualizations are presented in the notebook. Each model's effectiveness in predicting stock values is evaluated based on metrics like RMSE and MAE.
